 * exits 0 -- a pipeline that is red every night for seven known defects is a
 * pipeline nobody reads. What still fails is a route that 404s, a demo that
 * renders no chat surface, or an IDE view that cannot be built: those are
 * breaks in this repo, not in the thing under test.

 * into Notepad on screen and the row that ends up in the daily report are the
