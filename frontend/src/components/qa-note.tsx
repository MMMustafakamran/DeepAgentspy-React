/**
 * A short "what to try / what should happen" note on a demo route.
 *
 * These routes get screen-recorded, and the recordings have no voice track. The
 * recorder used to paint captions over the video to say what was being shown,
 * which read wrong: nobody testing an app can make a caption appear on screen.
 * A tester *can* leave a note on the page, so the explanation lives here in the
 * app instead, where it is something a person could actually have written.
 *
 * It earns its place most on the routes that are broken. "Nothing happened" is
 * ambiguous on video — it looks the same as a slow model or a page nobody has
 * touched yet. Stating the expected result next to the empty space is what
 * makes the absence legible.
 *
 * Keep it to one line each. This is a caption, not documentation, and it must
 * not push the thing being demonstrated off screen.
